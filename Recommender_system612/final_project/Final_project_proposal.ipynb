        "Find an interesting dataset and describe the system you plan to build out. If you would like to use one of the datasets you have already worked with, you should add a unique element or incorporate additional data. (i.e. explicit features you scrape from another source, like image analysis on movie posters). The overall goal, however, will be to produce quality recommendations by extracting insights from a large dataset. You may do so using Spark, or another distributed computing method, OR by effectively applying one of the more advanced mathematical techniques we have covered. There is no preference for one over the other, as long as your recommender works! The planning document should be written up and published as a notebook on GitHub or in RPubs.Please submit the link in the Unit 4 folder, due Thursday, July 5."

Later on, an item-item collaborative filtering recommeder system will be built to recommend and predict anime for users.

As I progress through the assignment, some attributes may change as I learn the data and the projected recommender system.\n",
