However that's to be expected the late 90's versus the beginning of the second decade of the twenty first century.There have been some complaints as to the older version games not being able to play on newer OS, that would be incorrect.We have OS's Windows: XP, Vista and 7; we have Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill (original), Stay Tuned for Danger, Message in a Haunted Mansion plus almost the rest of the Nancy Drew PC line running on these OS's.If you computer's OS isn't smart enough to switch over to the formats for you you can try the following instructions below; otherwise the game will install, but will not play because it was intended to run a much larger file in a much smaller window (I know that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it is correct in the way I explained it).This is what you need to do if you have a newer computer/OS (Windows: XP, Vista, 7, 8) and you are trying to play this older model game: You need to first install the game. It will do a computer anaylisis and will tell you that your computer \"Fails\" under two categories 1.) Color Resolution and 2.) OS (Operating System), ignore and install the game anyway. If you click to play the game after the install and an \"Error\" message appears close it and manually change your computer's compatibility mode.To set your computer to run in Compatibility Mode: This can be accessed from the Control Panel; just type in \"Older Version\" in the Control Panel Search Bar and the link will show up. Click it. A Dialog box will pop up and ask which version of Windows you would like to run this program in, choose either Windows: 95, 98 or ME.The computer should ask you if you wish to save this profile for every time you use this particular program click \"Yes\" or \"Apply\".Also from the Control Panel or by Right Clicking on your Desktop under \"Screen Resolution\" switch your pixel resolution all the way down to 800x600.If for some reason you computer does not switch back to normal once you've ejected the game, then once again, just reset the changes manually. The same goes for the fact, if your computer does not automatically set itself back to an older version of windows and a smaller screen resolution when you play the game again; just do it manually, it literally takes two minutes, both ways.Regardless of how much the graphics may suck, any older model game can play on a newer computer/OS whether it's on a CD-ROM or a Floppy Diskette (as long as you have a USB enabled External Floppy Diskette Drive or you hard wire one into your Desktop).</td><td>01 5, 2013</td><td>A1MYSISP73W2OZ</td><td>ShakespereIsMyMuse</td><td>Original Nancy Drew; Dual Sequel to the Game that Started It All</td><td>1357344000</td></tr><tr><td>0439671418</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I was impressed to find out that the game can be installed on Windows 7.

Scorpion, Jax, Sonya and Sub-Z return but that is basically it.The style of fighting is similar to UMK3 except that you can use weapons(somewhat)and move horizontally in the environment, which makes projectiles a bit less useful. The uber-boss, Shinnok, is actually a playable character and is far too easy to beat while the sub-boss, Goro, is next to impossible to defeat except with 1 or 2 specific fighters.Overall, I think this was one of the best MK games simply because it carries in the tradition of the glory days(MK 3).Note* This game did not work for me on Windows XP so beware, I also doubt that it will even run on Windows 2000.

Video Game Tycoon is a game where you're able to create your own video games. You can also burn them to a CD and show them to your friends. While this does sound awesome, the execution is not done all that well.The first thing you will notice is how dated the graphics are, even for 2006. Deus Ex (released in 2000) looks much better than this does. The animations are sloppy and the environments look bland.For the audio, the sounds effects are very stock and unimpressive. The music for the game is also pretty generic. However, you can put your own music into the game that you create if you change the format of the audio file.The game-play is decent enough. Being able to create your games from scratch is enjoyable. There is a good amount of customization you have when creating your games from the objectives of the level to the rewards for beating it. As you complete certain tasks, you unlock new features which give you much more customization to the various features of the levels.However, the mechanics are very limited. After testing out your games, you realize that the games feel very clunky. The controls are some of the worst in video games and there is absolutely no way to change the key bindings. Also, there is nothing really &#34;tycoon&#34; about it. You're not making games to sell them and there isn't any business aspect to it. It's very strange considering the word &#34;tycoon&#34; is in the title.Overall, I feel disappointed with this game. The concept is cool enough, but the execution was not up to par. However, I recommend you try this out for yourself and see how you like it. With the simplified mechanics, it's suited for younger audiences.</td><td>05 30, 2014</td><td>A261CI99KET69W</td><td>Pow3rh0use</td><td>Unique game with many flaws and limitations</td><td>1401408000</td></tr><tr><td>0545076412</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>4.0</td><td>We had this before and lost it.

Essentially, this game is about meeting the needs (food, drink, belongings, entertainment, community, etc.) of your citizens, which become increasingly demanding as they rise from the ranks of common workman to something equivalent of CEO.  With their progression brings higher taxes income, yielding a stronger economy capable of building and supporting an impressive military.  Warfare is not necessarily the focus, or even the majority of the fun, in this game, but it still gives the option for ship, submarine, and aerial combat, with several units of each type available.  You can even go nuclear.  It's pretty sweet.There are three \"races\" of people.  It's a bit like Starcraft in that they can each build their own units, and have their own specific needs.  The first group is the ECOS - they are the liberal hippy tree huggers who care only about thee environment, and turn unhappy if the ecobalance becomes too polluted.  The 2nd group, the TYCOONS, are the seal clubbin' oil drillin' conservatives who care only about making money no matter the cost.  Finally, you have the TECHS, a faction only concerned with technological research.  The TECHS are featured moreso in the expansion (ANNO 2070: Deep Ocean), but are still important for development of ECO and TYCOON needs as they advance.  I highly recommend the expansion if you play this and find you like it - it adds so many new ways to develop your cities.I love this game.  I've always been a fan of city builders, but this one (like ANNO 1404) has really drawn me in.  I've put in weeks worth of hours on it and am still playing.  The campaign missions are fun, but the real joy lies in a continuous game.  Once you are comfortable playing, you can spend literally hours on a hard continuous game with 3 AI players, a pirate base, and a warship hellbent on your destruction.  It is still a challenge even after playing for over a year.  I think a lot of what makes it fun is that no two games are ever played the same way.  There are different ways to power your city, different upgrades to utilize, different ways to destroy your opponents.A quick note about DRM: It sucks that this game must be played with a constant internet connection.  There is a multi-player faction, but honestly I've never even tried it.  Single player is what I enjoy, and there's no reason to be online for that.  Still, I give it five stars, because the game itself warrants it IMO.</td><td>05 13, 2013</td><td>A2IU72XM9F49P6</td><td>Brian V.

I have played all of the other titles in the Anno series so I was reasonably confident I would like this installment.I did, but...First off: no CD-KEY printed on the manual cover (a .pdf file to boot).  I spent the next 3 days exchanging emails with Ubisoft to get one.  This entailed screen caps of receipts, manual covers and proof of a real CD (they were very helpful).  Ok, Now I can play... NOT!  Every time it loaded, it Crashed To Desktop (CTD).Ok, so now I have spent another day looking up info on the web about that.  I had to lower my computer resolution to 800x600 AND change some of the graphics settings to low AND had to turn off stuff in the uPlay settings.Ok, finally got a profile setup (and you only get 1).  Now, I get to play... NOT!  Every time I accept a side mission it CTD's and I have to kill the proses just to exit the game.I can put up with a lot of stuff if the game runs, but I cannot deal with having to save before every quest, mouse over on the info tabs, etc just in case my game crashes.  Hell, I cannot even play single missions without it crashing.  I was hoping the expansion would help stabilize it, but I have decided to send them both back.I was willing to put up with uPlay, even if the DRM sucks.  What do you mean I can't change my hardware?  Ok, I have a laptop and thought that would be ok.  Till I found out that 3 is the limit.  I do plan to get several new computers over the next decade.I really wanted to play a more modern feeling Anno.

I got this on amazon to try it out and if I didn't like it I wanted to sell it, but having it required to attach to your uplay account basically didn't allow me to do that.

Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it.I was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap.It is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case.I am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it. When the PS4 and Xbox 720 come out, I think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident.</td><td>09 14, 2011</td><td>A1DLMTOTHQ4AST</td><td>ampgreen</td><td>awesome game, if it did not crash frequently !!</td><td>1315958400</td></tr><tr><td>0700099867</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>4.0</td><td>Pros:The game is about driving all sorts of vehicles on all different terrain, and at that the game does very well. There are a number of different vehicles to unlock in each vehicle category and the tracks range from asphalt to dirt to snow, some mixing the various terrains in a single course. If anybody has played any of the Colin McRae Rally games, or naturally any of the previous Dirt games, they should feel right at home* (see Cons for *).The game basically has the player build up his fame to gain more sponsorships and be invited to tournaments and open new seasons. In the first season you are shown all terrains types and give the opportunity to learn gymkhana (~stunt driving~).The graphics are polished and high quality, especially on the vehicles, and engine audio is up to par.Gameplay is fairly straightforward, yet quite entertaining. Smashing your and opponent's vehicles is a ton of fun and damage modeling is well done.Its just fun to drive and crash in the game. The game is very \"modular\" and can be picked up to play for just a short while or you can go all out and spend hours and hours.Cons:Gameplay can get repetitive, and even if the type of event is switched nearly every other race, you get to replay the same tracks, a number of times in different events (which are \"different\" really only by name).Car feel is somewhat bland, most cars in the same group feel very similar or nearly identical, the biggest difference you will feel is the stopping distance increase with more horsepower of the car. By contrast, this also makes it weird when a car actually behaves quite differently than the others, such as Ken Block's car or the Original Mini Cooper.In conjunction to the above, car handling is a bit weird at times, might be me, using a keyboard, but, during a normal dirt rally stage, you pretty much cannot recover from a real handbrake turn. Not sure if it is because of car tuning or abs still on (abs should not matter, but it's the only thing I have on) but once the car's back-end has slid around past say 20 degrees off center, the slide is irrecoverable. Does not matter if you apply full opposite lock, does not matter if you break, accelerate, or just let go of the gas pedal, does not matter what type of turn it is (shy of a hairpin), your call will keep sliding in the same direction, potentially getting more sideways, until you crash or slow down to 10 km/h (6mp/h).Games for Windows Live - whenever you see this logo, be afraid, very afraid! In Dirt 3, you will HAVE TO have or create a Windows Live account, or you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAVE THE GAME. Or play online for that matter. This is just some crappy DRM scheme and I was quite sad to find out about it, as this, plus having to always have the dvd in your drive, makes just booting the game an annoyance. Once all is set up, its not that bad of a hassle, but still, why punish players that buy the game?The menus and animations, and introductions will drive you up a wall. The are cool the first 100 times, -_- , not allowing me a way to skip them is just cruel. You will notice this the most when you enter a race: unskippable animation to show you your car, 1 second pause, menu pops up with \"Race\" and \"Mod car stuff\", etc, and then another 5 second animation to show you your car again, but on the starting grid, 1 second pause, and then its time to race, 3 second countdown till you can actually drive. Also every time you select an item from the race menu (those triangle things) again, animation, 1 second halt, here is what you ordered, oh new selection, sorry that need another animation.* People that were used to the Colin McRae games might be wondering where real rally went in the game. The one with the stages, and having to spend time in between races to repair damage, having to complete a few stages of a race with a half broken car. The special feeling of being part of the WRC is mostly gone. Now most races are on the short side (they do get longer as you progress), can be restarted at any point and no previous-race progress is lost, and even more there is the rewind feature. Naturally you do not need to use these mechanics, but just being there spoils the mood.Other Thoughts:It may seem like I slammed the game pretty hard, but then gave it a strangely high mark. The point is that the game is good, quite good, despite all the above issues, which all in all are actually fairly small things. Plus the cheap price bumps it up a notch.You will want to immediately turn off all assists (keep the driving line and abs at first, then decide for yourself) else the car basically drives itself.The loss of a true rally mode may be a make it or break it deal for somebody. The game is really fun, the driving is very fun regardless of the issues stated above, yet you will miss good ol' Colin.I would have given the game 3.5 out of 5, just because of the great stuff lost over the years, but I realized that it was not fair to compare it with something that (unfortunately) it is not anymore.For $12 it's a great deal.</td><td>08 16, 2012</td><td>A25K6I70BEHL1W</td><td>Andy</td><td>Great driving game with a few blemishes</td><td>1345075200</td></tr><tr><td>0700099867</td><td>List(2, 2)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I had Dirt 2 on Xbox 360 and it was an okay game.

Especially as the computer controlled cars don't always seem to realize that you're right beside them, and will hit you, causing you to spin out, wreck, or generally have problems.One of the more annoying things about this game is that you have to sign up for Microsoft Live, or something like that. You get a predetermined name, which is generally nonsense. And every time you want to play this game, you have to sign into Live.

The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series.At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal.Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.

Dirt3 tops it off.As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me.Pros:- Amazing graphics- Amazing physics- Challenging but entertaining racesCons:- Gymkhana- InterfaceWhat went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck.I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No!Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss.Conclusion:As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today.If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!In spite of my criticism, I definitely do not regreat this purchase.</td><td>10 19, 2011</td><td>ANW6EGY12V5XS</td><td>Henri Savin</td><td>A 5 stars winner!</td><td>1318982400</td></tr><tr><td>0700099867</td><td>List(0, 1)</td><td>5.0</td><td>Dirt 3 on DVDi collect racing games so had to add this to my collectionSon wated one also</td><td>12 29, 2013</td><td>AHT34BRYFBFT1</td><td>hewimp</td><td>Cars</td><td>1388275200</td></tr><tr><td>0700099867</td><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>5.0</td><td>can somebody tell me how to set this game on the pc with the logitech G27? i connected everything very well but still the game failed to play, i mean the car couldnt move anywhere</td><td>06 10, 2012</td><td>A12YFU8YNY11AW</td><td>ivantc</td><td>help..</td><td>1339286400</td></tr><tr><td>0700099867</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I don't do multiplayer games, just single player against the artificial racers.

There is absolutely no relationship to driving this \"car\" to anything in real life, other than when you step on the gas it goes forward.In actual rally driving you use throttle steering to actually steer the car; its the defining quality of racing on dirt.  To do that you need to be able to keep the steering wheel straight, and use the brake to shift weight forward and back to control car rotation. But in the game the car is impossible to steer straight going 5mpg on a straight road, let alone hit racing speeds.  I tried every single possible controller setting, and even bought a brand-new wheel. Both had the same problem: turning the wheel 5 degrees results in the steering inputs reacting as if I turned the wheel 10, or 15, or 20, or 30 degrees depending on the speed.The only workaround I could find was the \"dead zone\", making the wheel inoperable while centered, and then it violently overracts when turned outside of the dead zone.  Using that I could steer straight and then sharply turn, then go straight, then sharply turn.  Ridiculous, yes, but if you watch videos of people driving on youtube.com that's how the game was apparently designed.You'd think that a driver-oriented game would have a multitude of options for the most important aspect of driving: controlling the car.  Instead, the game is horribly slowed down by useless eye-candy graphics and a ridiculously obtuse interface.  Just starting the game and getting to the point of driving a car takes 10 minutes while you frantically hit the enter key trying to tell it to skip the fancy graphics and storyline and get on with the darn game.If its racing you want then iracing.com is still the only realistic option.

For those who don't know, gymkhana is an event where you drift through corridors, do donuts, jump ramps, and so on. I don't practice it because I don't like it, so those events tend to be frustrating.

Either way the game stopped working, wouldnt load anymore, and a window telling me that game copy was not origanal. So to me, with the other reviews saying game will not load. Im wondering if people are paying attention to windows saying why it will not load. Im guessing the seller or somebody who works there is taking the games number pass code and making copies. With the low  price of the game whos gonna go through the hassel and demand a refund after 3 or 4 months of having this game.

Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new.This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing.PROS:-Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects-Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive-Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling-In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins-Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea)-3D support!CONS:-Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard-Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though)-Essentially requires some sort of analog input-May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racingOther thoughts:-You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy!-LEARN THE TRACKS.

I bought the DVD version because I didn't want to deal with downloading on slow internet, but I see similar issues reported on steam forums.  I buy games on Amazon or Steam because I don't want to deal with the hassle of pirating.  I thought it wouldn't be worth the time, but this game makes me have second thoughts.  This game was not worth the time, and I've yet to be able to actually play a full race.It took two evenings from when I got home from work until after midnight just to get this game installed.  I wanted to try playing video games, so I bought a computer and some games.  The installation takes hours, crashed my computer multiple times, required many dependencies (like \"MS games for windows live\") that must be installed separately.  The only way to find out you need this other software is to search the forums... If you don't have some dependency, after an hour of waiting the install finishes but the game doesn't start.  I even had to edit XML configuration files to get the program to start at all.The game can't be played unless I am *both* logged into xbox live *and* have the DVD in the drive.  I find that DVD's scratch easily, I consider them transfer media not a reliable way to store data.  Since they already have the DRM of a mandatory windows-live service, I don't see why they would cripple the game even further with the disk requirement.  For this reason, if you ignore my advice, at least get the downloadable version.  I'll probably copy the dvd image to disk as an iso with CloneDrive, but it's an extra 7gb of data that has already been installed on my hard disk for a game that... can't be played anyway.Once I finally ironed out the installation issues, and was actually able to get the game started, 2 minutes into each attempt at a car race the entire computer would crash.  Black screen, unresponsive, numlock doesn't even change the lights on my keyboard, needing a hard-reboot.I know some will assume I just don't know how to install software, or that I have an old computer, or that I have viruses.  I'm a software engineer with over a decade of software development experience.  All of the other games I bought on Amazon or Steam worked fine (including one other that also required the windows live service).  My computer is two weeks old and fast, i5, 8gb of ram, a discrete graphics card, nearly brand new.  Even if this was a resource issue, the game shouldn't consistently crash my entire computer to the point of needing a hard reboot.  The price for the game isn't high, but don't waste your *time* on the PC version of this game.If you're a young kid and you've got all of your summer vacation to play around with figuring out installation issues, maybe this will be a good learning experience for you.  If you have a job, and just want something fun to to do once in a while on a PC, look elsewhere.</td><td>05 18, 2013</td><td>AIOQYO1HHLMBV</td><td>nairbv</td><td>Doesn't work in Windows 7 64b, lots of DRM</td><td>1368835200</td></tr><tr><td>0700099867</td><td>List(4, 7)</td><td>1.0</td><td>So you just want to buy and play this great rally racing game?

Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating \"music\" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.

In fact, you can modify the database to unlock all the cars, all the races. Just google \"dirt 3 unlock mod.\"  The file is a replacement for \"database.bin\" - so all you have to do is search for that file, save the original file as backup and replace it with the unlocked database. (And, after you play through to the next level, you can put the original file back.)  It's a fairly easy fix even for the so-so computer literate.The upshot though is, Codemasters could have included an option to bypass gymkhana for those just wanting rally and not screech-braking in a parking lot.This game did work without a problem on Win 7 64-bit with a Thrustmaster Ferrari GT Experience wheel.</td><td>08 15, 2012</td><td>A1Q80TZVF5TCY2</td><td>R.

I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt.  Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.

Instead of the kind, warm, and friendly voice of an Alex Trebek or Regis Philbin, the host of  \"You Don't Know Jack\" is more reminiscent of  Anne Robinson from THE WEAKEST LINK with his sarcastic comments and snide asides.  It makes for a fun, entertaining, and educational experience.  This is the YOU DON'T KNOW JACK MOVIES and the questions all have something to do about film.  Don't be fooled by the playfulness and multiple-choice options, some of these questions are extremely difficult to get, even if your mind is a walking encyclopedia of film knowledge.  The game can be played in two different formats: a seven question round and a twenty-one question round.  The seven question format takes about fifteen minutes to play while the longer version takes almost forty-five.  Most of the questions are in multiple choice, but there are different types:  picture questions, fill in the blanks, whatshisname questions, gibberish questions, dis or dat choices, and the final round of the game is called Jack Attack (an association question).  I've found the gibberish questions the most difficult because it takes me a little longer to remember movies that sound like what appears on the screen.  Also, if you play the game with more than one person there is a \"screw your neighbor round\" where you can force someone else to answer a question instead of yourself.  This is a wonderful game that I thoroughly enjoy playing.

I'm going for the entire series. Yet I see one-star reviews of this great game because why? \"THE GAME DOESN'T WORK!\" Now, I can get that not everyone's a computer-savvy person, but I got dang near the entire Jack series working on Windows 7, 64bit. How? By using Microsoft Virtual PC and Windows 98. (NOT Windows XP Mode unless your have a high-end version of Windows). Anyway, the way I got these to work is use Virtual PC with a legitimate CD of Windows 98 (still love it, baby!) and install '98 on the virtual computer. (You have to have Win98 AT LEAST to get this trick to work. '95 and 3.1 are both no-goes. I'd assume any other Windows version that supports 16bit apps will work for you.) Next, make sure you've installed Virtual Machine Additions, and enable hard drive sharing. That allows you to access the physical hard drives on your that you tell Virtual PC to share in the settings. Next, put your YDKJ CD or ISO image in, capture the drive, (this trick works with any Jack game save for 5th Dementia...you'll just have to install and play that one on the virtual machine), install the game, then copy the entire contents of the Jack CD (save for the setup files), overwrite anything and everything, then try running the game without the CD. If it runs, then copy the game's folder on to your computer's physical hard drive. Then in your newer Windows system, make sure that you apply the 640x480 resolution compatitbilty setting to the game. That prevents the game from being a tiny window in the middle of the screen. Now, create a shortcut if you so desire, and run the game.

The whole point is that you're racing a car and trying to beat other computer controlled cars around the track. With the skin conductance and heart rate monitor (which attaches to your fingertips) you control the car's speed. You increase your speed by slowing down your breathing, heart rate, and skin conductance and getting into a meditative state. Yet the faster you make your car go the louder the music becomes and the more exciting the games gets (i.e. the competition with other cars and drive to achieve the goal of finishing the race increases). And thus the better you do at racing the car the harder it gets to increase its speed due to the increasing difficulty of relaxing. This is directly applicable to test anxiety which is aided by learning to relax even in stressful situations.However, if you are new to biofeedback (or don't have a lot of practice) consider starting with a program such as Healing Rhythms first. Dual Drive Pro is VERY challenging and takes practice before you can succeed. It may be discouraging at first, which isn't ideal when learning relaxation. Part of the difficulty though is also part of the appeal as the game is incredibly sensitive and gives almost instant feedback on the slightest increase in tension or excitation.

I can see why, but it's also clear to me why it was one of my cherished games as a late teen. The collective of writers, graphic artists and composer(s) in Bloodnet are nothing short of brilliant when it comes to setting a particular mood. I would label this unique mood as urban-dystopian-futuristic-cyberpunk-gothic-mystic that ends up being both oppressive and enchanting at the same time, quite a feat. It's amazing what Microprose can bring out of the dedicated player with little more than a mixture of pre-rendered and handdrawn futuristic stills and peculiar midi music to match. Especially back as a teen, Bloodnet's distinctive atmosphere engulfed my very spirits and managed to linger around me even when I was not actually playing it. Few games (or movies, or books) are capable of this as it takes a certain kind of giftedness, one that this staff happened to possess. VTM: Bloodlines comes to mind, and a couple of others.I also like the fact that Bloodnet is a game of alloys: alloying classic adventure with RPG, distant future with Medieval vampire myths, a bright and loud metropolis with a dark and silent mystery, a detailed and possible future with implausible supernatural goings-on. This aspect was accomplished well.On the bad side, the game feels like it is not interested in letting us actually play it, but only showing off its great graphics, ambient music and, above all, writing. At the same time, it has high ambitions of attempting to merge the genres of point-and-click adventure and strictly stat-based RPG. The end result is a weird mishmash of endless conversations, heavy turn-based combat, and wandering about on motionless landscapes. Weirdness can be a good and a bad thing, and in this case it's both. Part of the appeal, I think (at least for me).My biggest beef with the overall experience is the pre-scripted, absolutely non-interactive dialogs. Again, the sprawling, gritty conversations in this game are masterfully written and are more memorable than the ones in most big-time movies I've seen, but leaving them non-interactive is the biggest deal-breaker, a missed chance for an additional layer of depth and player involvement.Bloodnet is not a good game. It feels static and almost non-interactive. It is, however, a good experience. So good that it ended up as one of the very few games from the early 90's that I actively revisit from time to time. The ultimate praise I can give the game, I think, is that it is a spiritual and atmospheric precursor to the Deus Ex series and VTM: Bloodlines, which are of course much better games, but Bloodnet holds its own against them in terms of mood, writing and originality. No small feat for a 1993 DOS game.</td><td>11 25, 2011</td><td>A2IEBEVHTWY0LJ</td><td>Andras Gregorik</td><td>The original urban-dystopian RPG</td><td>1322179200</td></tr><tr><td>1563820412</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I wanted computer crossword puzzles for brain health.

It seems like every other creature or NPC has a main stat that is great (+4 to rolls) or better for combat. This is countered by them not being able to take consequences like your character can, but it makes combat encounters pretty much a straight forward affair and the game is obviously based off a D20 type playstyle. D20 is great for what it is, a crunchy rule system for straight combat systems with little room for sway, however the Fate system is way more story focused and is about applying your characters strengths and weaknesses in unique ways. Combat and dice rolls are a very small part of the Fate Core experience and the Fate Freeport Companion seems to miss this concept. I still like the FFC because of the world, the characters, the ideas, and the overall concept and I can appreciate that Brian Engard and Clark Valentine were trying to combine these two systems in a way that made for a kind of 'common ground' feel, but it isn't freeform enough for one (Fate) and not rule specific enough for the other (D20).If a retread were attempted to remove the more crunchy elements and the system were to focus on the pure Fate aspects of the city and gaming sessions, I could easily recommend this as must have for a resource book for people wanting a fleshed out fantasy setting for Fate sessions. As it is right now though, I wouldn't recommend this book for Fate fans or D20 fans on the whole. If you are looking for settings for a Fate game, the Fate Worlds books are a better value in that they give you a setting, a general concept of what is going on, examples of characters, main players, etc. while leaving enough open for you to customize your gaming sessions and I feel they are much better values for your money and time. That said, I really do hope this setting is revisited and more refined for the Fate system because it is a very, very nice setting and I will still be pulling stuff out of it for my gaming sessions, but I would recommend newer players avoid this book because the skill change and combat heavy elements might turn you away from what Fate is all about.</td><td>06 27, 2014</td><td>A3TGHJJ3ZE8KCH</td><td>S.

As always the components from Fantasy Flight are durable and all accounted for.  The book was also quite hefty coming in around 190 pages.  Considering There isn't really any messing around in the book, 190 pages is a lot of information.  The quality of the pages, binding, and organization was also great and I don't see myself having to rebind and cover the book like many other companies role playing products, Steve Jackson Games have the worst binding!The way the campaign flows is very smooth and I like how the option to use Hero's Call material is open if you choose to.  I also love how they do the \"bad guy\" ;)  No spoilers!The only negative thing I can bring are that it's not a full reboot of the original which I was hoping for as the original was a ton of products 5 in total with 2 other option 1/2 products you could add in if you wanted to.  Overall though, I am still satisfied with my purchase.  But at the same time, if this was a reboot of the original I'd probably be very disappointed as I already have them!  Overall, it has the same feel as there is an enemy within, but the story is completely different and pulled off very well.Comparing this to other campaigns, I honestly would have a hard time doing it.

All of these reviews are reviews on another chess product- Convetka's \"CT ART 3.0\".CT-ART 3.0I recognize this because I own both pcs of software.  Actually, the review by the \"GAMESMAN\" is an absolute schill. This fellow actually describes the \"CT ART 3.0\" product using the \"Think Like a King\" verbage like 'workouts' etc.  That's a real shame.Now I will discuss the product \"Think Like a King\".  It is strictly a scholastic teaching pc of software.  It is basically an interactive E-book reader.  The graphical interface opens 1 of 7 E-books, the 'workouts'.  The graphical interface shows a board and a chess position; the text is on the right describing the subject, such as 'en prise' and the problem on the board.  The user follows the directions of the text and often gets to make a move on the board.This is not a Michael Dela Maza style tactics drill software like CT ART 3.0 is.  It is a beginners introducutory course on chess which focuses on tactical elements.  There are series of 10-20 chess problems for the user to answer at the end of each chapter (or lesson) in the books.  It's a fine pc of software for a child.  Please go to [...] to find out about the product.I don't want to tear the product down, but AMAZON and/or Chess Central is engaing in false advertising here.  It's a shame because myself and many others use these reviews as a guide for purchasing products.AMAZON.COM please fix this!!!!

Additionally, it offers exceptional value for your money providing 100s of hour of valuable training for a very modest price.General comment on Tactical Training:Mastering the Tactical training consists of fast and accurate recognition of standard tactical ideas (motifs) and ability to calculate. Your training should be split in two parts - learning the motifs and then improving you ability to calculate. In the early positions you will have to go through simple 1-2 moves tactics involving double attack, deflection, attraction, and other basic tactical motifs. As you progress - you will have to deal with multiple tactical ideas, longer variations and more resourceful defense.The rating you get is more generous than it should have been, but nevertheless a good indicator of your progress.This tool is ideal for practicing! I use this software regularly so do most of my students.

My rating on ICC went up about 100 points and, equally important, my confidence grows accordingly. Wonder what this will do to my future otb-rating (ELO).Only two complaints:1)When taking a test there's no \"counter\" visible, so you don't have a clue how many puzzles you still have to go (I like the way other programs of theirs - like \"Intermediate Tactics\" give information like \"#5 of 50\").2)When you make a few mistakes, a small window opens up, showing you a similar position as the one you're trying to solve, which you can practice on, but... where the \"main puzzles\" have the (option of showing the) color you're playing at the bottom of the board, these small \"help boards\" always show the position from the White side.I find the above mentioned \"shortcomings\" annoying, but maybe it's just me...Overall, definitely a program worth buying, although I'd suggest you get \"Total Chess Training\", which not only contains CT-ART 3.0, but also 4 other interesting programs (Encyclopedia of Middlegames, Encyclopedia of Opening Blunders, Studies 2.0 and Strategy 2.0) for about $95.

Second, chess combinations are well tested, and one can check his or her own solution using the built in Craft chess engine.  Finally, the system provides hints if you make a wrong move, allowing one to gradually work up to harder problems.

By improvement, I mean that it does deeper searches much quicker.  (This is useful for analyzing opening lines.)  Besides analysis, everything else is pretty much the same.  The Fritz programs are probably not the best for playing for anybody rated below 1900.  The modes for weaker players are not very interesting because they are designed to make random gross blunders.

It has all the features you want: great database, an engine you can customize to your level, great analysis function, a computer that can beat the socks off you if you need it.  And of course, the program is designed ideally for Fritz.  If you go for one, only get Fritz.Here's what I thought about some of the new features: The 3d improvements are great for a few games.  Then you go back to 2D because it's still easier.  I've run this program against several others on my computers.  It matches well against Rybka and is superior to everything else.  If you already own another recent chessbase engine, though, you won't find anything really new here.</td><td>01 11, 2007</td><td>A219P4I3QXS2FB</td><td>Kadh2000 \"Klingon Gamer\"</td><td>The best engine for Chessbase GUI</td><td>1168473600</td></tr><tr><td>3866810067</td><td>List(35, 38)</td><td>4.0</td><td>Fritz 10 is the latest and greatest version of the German chess program put out by ChessBase, a specialist in chess database and playing software. It boasts a set of new features and improvements over its predecessor, and all indicators suggest that it delivers. That said, Fritz 10 may or may not be a wise purchase, depending on why you want it.I will start off by saying that if you are interested in this package as a playing partner and you already have a very strong chess engine to spar with, Fritz 10 is likely a waste of money for you. As another reviewer stated, the engine is so strong that it will crush all but the top grandmasters in the world, so casual play will be frustrating for hobbyists. However, if you want it because you plan to do some serious analysis work and you want the latest engine, it is worth more consideration, though there are stronger engines such as Shredder and Hiarcs. Fritz 10 does a nice job of automatically analyzing games, adding some natural language notations with the move notations, although it is debatable whether or not these notations are very useful.The improvements over its predecessor are mainly in the GUI, not the engine (although the engine shows some promising improvements as well but does not drastically demonstrate strength over its predecessor, Fritz 9). There are some new training features such as showing the engine's plans, which is a solid tool in the toolbox when trying to improve. The sparring and friend modes are also very helpful, though I must concur with the previous reviewer in that the engine makes some silly moves when you \"dumb it down\" to meet the player's skill level.The graphics ability of this package are much improved, offering better piece rendering and display. This is not necessarily a very important feature unless you like your eye candy.As a UCI client, ChessBase seems to have ironed out the problems of the past. The GUI even seems to have a fairly good idea of how strong imported engines are, which is made clear when playing rated games. In testing a few imported engines, Fritz 10 did well in managing these engines and everything was stable.Updates to the PlayChess interface include weather reporting. I have to ask: How useful is this in a chess program?Overall, Fritz 10 is a very nice package and is worth the money if you want a strong program that can analyze games and can connect you to other players on the net. There are stronger engines out there (and some of them are free downloads) so if you are looking for the very best engine on the market, this isn't it. Also, if you have an earlier version and you want it because it's \"the latest and greatest\" in the hopes of getting a hugely improved playing engine, you'll probably be disappointed. However, if you want pretty graphics and an intuitive interface or if you are looking for a good training tool that can help you to understand your game a little better, Fritz 10 is a good choice.</td><td>12 1, 2006</td><td>A34VRVI4CSI5RQ</td><td>Matthew K.

There are a couple of stronger engines, like Rybka 2.1 and Hydra,but any engine strong enough to defeat the world champion isstrong enough for me. (Note: Kramnik recently lost to the Deep versionof Fritz 10, but basically the difference between the two is lessthan 30 elo points. And that's on the slowest time control. (On anytime control of an hour or less per game, any of the top 5 chess programsdominates Kramnik and Topalov, the 2nd best human chess player.Where the (world grandmaster strong engine) comes in handy is not in playing against it, (A most frustrating endeavor to be sure),but in helping a player \"see\" what the engine is thinking. No human or even chess program can play perfectly, but today's top engines comepretty darn close, as Kramnik can attest to.You can of course tweak the engine to play weaker, but onebad point of Fritz is when it \"dumbs down\" it's engine, itdoes so at the expense of realistic play. I.E. leaving a pieceen prise, which doesn't happen often even among \"mere\" experts.at slow time controls.The user interface on Fritz 10 however is very user friendly. The browser like icons on top of the picture is one example.If you're not sure what an icon is for, just hover the mouse overthem and it will tell you. Everything is customizable from thelook and feel of the board to the sounds, even to such minutedetails like the look of the fonts on the notation.All very intuitive.There is an updated database (to 9/06) which includes thecontroversial Topalov-Kramnik match. You can search among1,100,000 games by name, opening, position, even endgame pieces.You can play some historical games by such great playerslike Fischer and Capablanca, and you can see how many \"inaccuracies\"they made. And brilliant moves as well.But for me, the best part of Fritz 10 or any chessbase compatiblechess program, is the play server. That alone is worth the priceof the program. It's simply the best place to play. At this server,you also get to watch grandmasters play blitz and whenever there is abig tourney like Linares or a world championship match you can watchevery move LIVE. And unlike most chess servers, here all your gamesare kept on a separate database that you played online, and studythem with the help of your world class analysis partner, Fritz.This is very long I realize but I haven't come close to touchingon all the features like training modes, 3-D graphics, chess variantslike giveaway and chess 960, importing chess books etc.If you have Fritz 9 and your one year subscription to it's playchessserver has not yet expired, then perhaps you don't need to get Fritz 10.But if you're anyone else who plays chess and loves following thegames of great players, then you won't go wrong with Fritz 10.</td><td>01 20, 2007</td><td>A353B5OAAU2IP5</td><td>Nathaniel E.

Secondly, I would think that anyone who would install a chess program on their device is serious about chess, so this product review is not for, and will not be recommend this product to beginners. However if you are opened minded about learning new software and you casually like chess I say give it a go.  In a nutshell, why I would not recommend this to beginners is that I think that's a necessary for a demo of this product to be available for them to get a feel for the software, as it would obviously help beginners and novices understanding the training sections without having to pay for it first.  The training section is a little underwhelming for someone over 1800 USCF ELO, especially the tactical training - there should be more puzzles added from time to time perhaps or the ability for user created puzzles to be shared through the servers, as the puzzles included are not really all that challenging.  The Opening training is pretty decent and you can learn an Opening on the fly, say if you are at a tournament and you just want to whip up something new right before you play your next game, you can definitely benefit here, and the included ECO theory is quite handy, especially for fast chess. The Endgame training is OK for 1600 USCF ELO or less players, and it should include access to 3,,4,5,6 Men Tablebases, Pocket Shredder has this is if this is what you are looking for, but it doesn't and its not that big of a deal, but for the more serious players such as myself it would be greatly appreciated.  Another feature that I would like to see in Pocket Fritz 4 (the next version of this software) is DGT compatibility, again the more serious player would gratefully appreciate this.  But to make up for its shortcomings there are two things that help make for it being a great pocket chess companion that I'll I point out, and the first being the instant access to chesslive.de, the complete game database of Chessbase (over 4 million games), so you can search, and play over any player's games that you wish at anytime, and the second thing is the ability to set-up the board with random positions to train yourself with, say you could play a handicap game with Knight odds for example. There are other little touches, cosmetic and functionally, that make it a great program, but what do you want such a program for in the first place? As a pocket chess companion and it does that quite well. I would highly recommend this program for casual to serious chess playes only, and by serious I am not suggesting you need be a certain rating to be serious, but one that does study and plays chess quite regularly.</td><td>04 8, 2009</td><td>A2BY2QHB6S6ZCO</td><td>Christopher L.

The program is smart enough to obliterate just about anyone, but you can play the game at several different difficulty levels. It even has a friend mode where the computer determines how strong a chess player you are and plays at close to your level. This is one tough opponent - even in the friend mode. There are also several \"personalities\" you can play against. Each personality has preprogrammed strengths and weaknesses (including how badly it blunders). You can also change several of their attributes to make them a stronger or weaker player.Fritz 12 is packed with training tools. You can set the game up so it suggests opening moves; warns you if a square you are about to move to is under attack; give you hints or suggested moves; tell you what your opponent is planning to do; and much more.The free beginner training videos are good. There are also several sample videos for other topics included, in hopes you decide to purchase additional training videos.Even at full price this is a terrific training tool and should certainly help you improve your game, even though you may get a bit frustrated if you like to win.</td><td>07 27, 2010</td><td>A1PAGBU5YFMI4R</td><td>John E.

I played it at this level using Online Chess Kingdom and Chess master (PSP games) at the highest level vs. fritz set to the min level, and so they lost to fritz. It was easy to tell Fritz wasn't playing at 1100 ELO, but closer to 2000. The PS3 version of Fritz doesn't have this shortcoming, you feel drastic changes at different ELO ratings, but this computer version you don't feel much ELO change. Another shortcoming is that the game freezes if you choose the \"render light\" option, it slows down significantly if you improve all the graphics in the option menu, and the game flashes once in a while. Some windows don't close despite they have the \"x\". The clicking sound can be deactivated, but it takes some googling time to find out how. On the positive site, the sense of humor is a unique touch, since playing chess can get really quiet. This game could use more chess sets and picture wall papers like in Chess Master.

I started using Fritz at version 6 and have purchased most of the upgrades, up to version 10. With each successive version the whole package has gotten better and better though some of the upgrades were more worthwhile than others (one reason I never purchased version 11). Version 12 is a quantum leap forward, though it is still not perfect.Installation from the DVD was painless and uneventful. However, there is one issue with the installation that bothered me - the installer never installed a desktop icon or a program group, so I needed to navigate to the installation directory, from which I made a shortcut to the application binary on the desktop. After this step, everything has worked smoothly and I can launch the application without issue.The interface has gotten a huge facelift - this is not a color scheme change or rearrangement of the menus and toolbars, but rather it is a complete overhaul with Windows ribbon controls serving up the components. Normally, I would be wary of such a large change to the overall interface, but ChessBase has done an excellent job of designing the interface and it is very well-organized. There is a learning curve, though, for people who have grown very accustomed to the older ChessBase interface, as some things are a little difficult to find unless you have familiarity... Given a couple of hours of exploration, the interface becomes second nature and finding things becomes easy again.The Fritz engine itself is a strong one, able to crush practically any human player (including seasoned grandmasters) with ease when used at full playing strength and it holds its own against other top-drawer engines. It is not the strongest engine available, but for the vast majority of players it doesn't need to be the strongest. When using an engine this strong, playing against it is not the most useful activity; where engines of this strength are most useful is in the analysis of games.Fritz includes several analysis modes, my favorite being full analysis for post-mortem scrutiny of games. The full analysis function works backward through a game and adds move suggestions as well as canned commentary as the selected chess engine evaluates each position. Though the English commentary is not always especially informative (for example, comments like \"This is a futile try to save the game\" are common), the comments do add a more \"personal\" touch to the analysis which would otherwise be simply a dump of suggested moves. When the engine finds an especially good move, the commentary is usually a little more helpful.I found an annoying glitch with the Full Analysis mode. After fully analyzing a game, the interface simply chopped the last quarter of the game from the report, even though I could still iterate through all of the moves. I never could get the rest of the analysis on the screen.Another very helpful analysis mode is \"Infinite Analysis\" which takes a single position and continuously analyzes it until the engine is interrupted or the position is changed. This is especially helpful for taking a deep look at a position and trying several what-if scenarios.Deep position analysis is another mode, as is Monte Carlo, though I have used these so little that I cannot really comment on them.The last analysis mode I will talk about is \"Engine Shootout\" which takes a position and feeds it to two or more engines for analysis. These engines evaluate the position and play through, with the intent of determining how the game would proceed and the outcome as a result. Though it's a feature I really don't need, it is something I use occasionally to look at games I have played when the game was unfinished but the outcome wasn't clear. Different engines arrive at different conclusions which makes this even more intriguing.The Fritz package includes a large database of games, which can be used to explore and analyze. Where I find this database to be most useful is in researching specific styles of play. For example, it is easy to track down all of Tal's games and follow his playing style with the database search functions.Also included on the DVD is a set of training videos. To be honest I have never found these to be especially helpful but others may very well benefit from them.The UCI interface continues to improve, so adding in UCI engines is easy and reliable. I have found several weaker engines against which I can play so I have them bound into the interface for playing. I use the Fritz 12 engine for analysis after the fact.Central to the Fritz interface is access to the ChessBase chess server. Through the interface, players can log into the server, play games, read chess-related news, watch seminars, and observe important matches with live coverage.There are a couple of different versions to this package. The version sold by ChessBase and its resellers sports a green box whereas the version sold through Viva Media comes in a black box. I noticed an appreciable price difference and I investigated that difference. The software appears to be the same; the real difference is in the access given to the chess server. The more expensive package offers a 1-year premium membership which gives access to all content on the server such as seminars, elite tournament coverage and other content. The less expensive package also offers a 1-year membership but the access is more limited and excludes much of the premium content. Both offer guest access which allows anyone to log in and play games without hindrance, but as a guest so there is no tracking of progress. Which kind of access you desire should be considered when choosing which package you need.Fritz 12 is a big step forward and is a worthwhile upgrade from previous versions. The engine is stronger and the interface is vastly superior. It is not without its glitches but the problems seem to be few in number.</td><td>10 7, 2010</td><td>A34VRVI4CSI5RQ</td><td>Matthew K.

The DVD is in the form of a games collection, with all of the major variations covered.  Kasparov's presentation is fascinating.  He gives a blend of historical background and fundamental instruction.  His accent is rather strong, but he is quite eloquent, charismatic and in general easy to understand.  You will not get every theoretical variation that you would need to play the Queen's Gambit at a high level with such a general overview, of course, but this DVD is so compelling and well done that any chess player from casual club player up to master (and probably beyond) will benefit from the presentation.  Don't miss the chance to get instruction from the player that many consider the strongest player of all time.

Yet another downside!Another thing in the game is' The Pavillion' In there , you can see all the trophies and stadia you have unlocked. You can also check out the world records.In the game itself, you can pick one of 12 teams. You can then play a 20 over , 50 over or the longest form, the grueling test match . There are three difficulties.Another 'up' is the customization. You can change the player's name, his appearance,his kit or you can edit his skills. Of course, you cannot edit the Aussies or English.</td><td>11 27, 2011</td><td>A1OZ5EU2U9Y2KD</td><td>cocobrown</td><td>Ashes 2009</td><td>1322352000</td></tr><tr><td>5293009893</td><td>List(2, 3)</td><td>5.0</td><td>Cricket games have never captured the public imagination like, say, football games, mainly because a more complex sport is bound to breed a less-easily-grasped video game.But Codemasters' Brian Lara-branded games of yore consistently outshone their rivals, and finally, the Britsoft publisher has acquired the plum cricketing licence: the Ashes. It's a big shame that Ashes Cricket 2009 didn't make it to the crease in time for the first Test in Cardiff, but at least it's a classy and thoroughly playable effort.</td><td>12 2, 2009</td><td>A1SF615ZY2QZQD</td><td>Gary Hyman</td><td>Tally Ho Good Time!</td><td>1259712000</td></tr><tr><td>5293009893</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>Love the game, cant stop playing. grt graphic. such games are hard to find these days. would recommend this game.

Wrist snapping as the ball tore from the young leg-spinner's hand, it swerved improbably through the air. Twisting away to Mike Gatting's leg-side, the bemused England veteran instinctively thrust out his left lag and jabbed the bat against it to create what should have been an impervious shield between man and wicket. But as the ball pitched up from the rough it spun back implausibly, miraculously, wide of man, bat and pad,thundering into off stump. Pandemonium.It was the first Test of the 1993 Ashes series at Old Trafford. And the first ball bowled against England by a cocky 23 year-old with look-at-me hair and pie-in-me paunch. Shane Warne had arrived.Fast forward 12 years. They called it the greatest ever series. Warne, by then the finest spinner the world had ever known, had privately decided this would be his Test swansong: to reclaim the famous Urn on English soil, conjuring victory through an almost superhuman force of will and talent, capping off a glittering career of personal achievement and ruthless international dominance.But on the final day of the final Test at the Oval, one man above all others refused to play to the script. And having been clumsily dropped, with savage irony, by Warne himself at slip on 15, Kevin Pietersen produced one of the great innings, a knock of breathtaking audacity, defiance, skill and aggression against unbelievable pressure, to drive England on to an unforgettable victory.For cricket lovers, there's nothing like a Test match. And on the international stage, there's nothing quite like the Ashes. Making a cricket game is one thing; creating one that captures the unique emotions of this rivalry is quite another. That's the starting point for Ashes Cricket 2009, the latest cricket game from Codemasters, whose last effort in 2007 featured Brian Lara's mug on the box.But last time we checked, Lara wasn't a bowler hat-wearing lager lout or a kangaroo-riding Neighbours extra, so his services have been dispensed with, Codies has snapped up the official nPower Ashes licence, and Pietersen and Warne have been called to the promotional crease.</td><td>12 2, 2009</td><td>A1VZFTEZJ88O7N</td><td>Lilla Houston</td><td>For every Cricket Fan!</td><td>1259712000</td></tr><tr><td>5293009893</td><td>List(1, 2)</td><td>5.0</td><td>In terms of game modes there's everything here most cricket fans will want. The Ashes themselves are the main draw, backed up by the proper licence (although we're not sure if player likenesses were part of that deal, as most only vaguely match their real life counterparts). Outside of this test series mode you've got One Day and 20 over matches, although neither is a licensed tournament, so there's no properly named Twenty20. There are numerous challenges to complete too, set by legends Sir Ian Botham and Shane Warne.Although the batting and bowling is solid enough, the on-field presentation is lacking slightly. Player models and stadiums are decent, but the animations are clunky and don't blend into one another well at all. There's also a strange delay when a wicket is taken, meaning you'll know you're out but the fielders won't react. Then a second later they'll all leap into the air to celebrate. For a fairly average looking game the frame rate isn't too hot either, frequently appearing a fraction too slow. Commentary is decent and the voice work by Beefy and Warne is solid, if a little sterile, but on the whole it's not a game to show off to your mates.Ashes Cricket 2009 is a solid recreation of the sport and this summer's big sporting event, but it's lacking spark and feels a little slight in terms of depth. Play with a friend as opposed to the AI and you'll likely be able to have fun up to and beyond the end of the Ashes series, but as a next-gen sports sim it doesn't feel as though Codemasters has done enough to push the series forward.</td><td>12 2, 2009</td><td>AZJ1ACKWFAP8Q</td><td>Matthewwhite</td><td>5 Star plus game</td><td>1259712000</td></tr><tr><td>5293009893</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>Usually play this to calm my nerves after an engaging chapter of any FPS....this is very relaxing and fun.

After receiving the microphone in question, I plugged it into my USB port, only to find that it didn't work.  &#34;Odd,&#34; I thought and tried a different USB port.  This one worked, and I began playing.Now, to give a bit of backstory.  I have two televisions in my room:  an HDTV and a normal &#34;box&#34; television.  After getting fed up with attempting to calibrate the system correctly, I now move back and forth between the two televisions whenever I wish to play a musical rhythm game.  Obviously, for vocals, an HDTV can be used uncalibrated, as, if you know the song, you do not need to watch the notes go by, so I had had the Xbox plugged into this.  Later, when I decided to switch TVs to play my guitar, I eventually replugged in the microphone in the same USB port that I had plugged it in previously.  It didn't work.  Now frustrated, I retried every port, only to finally find one that worked, which happened to be the very first port I'd tried previously.  I later came to find that the microphone I received had a short in the wire, almost as if it were used (which is entirely possible, as I got no packaging, only a plastic wrapper around the microphone).  As for the performance itself when I actually get the thing to work, it works nicely.  It picks up on my voice fairly well, although you have to keep it at a very precise angle, or it may lose lower volumes.  There is enough cord length that I can sing at my preferred distance (although I sit very close to my televisions, so take this statement with a grain of salt).  It's not a bad mic, and I'm sure the short was just a defect on the part of my microphone.

It has a fun art style, no matter how drastic it is from the other games, with fun gameplay. Link gets a version of his traditional gear, plus a few new ones. There's some familiar and unfamiliar places, concepts, music, and faces, but, as always, Link still gets to be the hero. One thing different about the gameplay, though, is some consistent option of sneaky movements like the ability to crawl on any floor and sidle on any wall; Link becomes your little Solid Snake in the making.As with other games of the Legend of Zelda series, if you haven't played one of them before they can be a bit more challenging until you get used to general gameplay, the patterns for where to go, how to solve puzzles, etc. It also can be frustrating/boring to some people because of the amount of sailing it requires for a good portion of the game, but if you can get through that, I have no qualms about the game. Preference of art style is always a factor for some people, so if you really don't like what you see in pictures, I do not suggest this game for you; it's funny and cute through and through.Overall, it's a really fun Legend of Zelda game for practically any age with non-bloody action, adventure, and puzzle solving, one that once completed will still be fun to repeat play again and again.</td><td>10 4, 2009</td><td>A2Q5ZDVPELFG2U</td><td>D.

A lobotomy patient, a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort. Just mash buttons or &#34;spam&#34; the controls as PC gamers would say and you'll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face Disney level Aonuma dreck.Graphics: Hideous, vomit inducing, ridiculous, teletubbies-esque, bait and switch from what we were originally promised at Spaceworld 2000 (realistic style epic, cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly Lord Of The Rings style flare) Also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout Wand Wacker indicating Nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release. Oh what a shame.Sound: The only redeemable inspiring thing about this Aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by Koji Kondo. The rest is detestable Saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel. Soccer moms and grandparents should approve. Real Zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect Nintendo has stooped to in order to insult us.Theme: Near total rip off of Kevin Costner's Water World to such a great extent I fully believe Costner could probably win a lawsuit against Nintendo for royalties if he so desired. Needless to say this watery environment is not what true Zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new Zelda game. No, what we're looking for is the green forests and fields of Hyrule proper, not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to Aonuma's child learning how to bathe for the first time and Aonuma getting inspired to make Zelda into a giant bathing simulator via Wand Wacker. I've said it before and I'll say it again Nintendo needs to fire Eiji Aonuma and his entire Zelda team and get normal people developing the Zelda series again for it to return to health.Commentary: The online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to re-write history all they like but The Legend Of Celda: Wand Wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history.This was Nintendo, Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma's Vince Mcmahon esque &#34;Screw you!&#34; to the true Zelda fanbase and by true Zelda fanbase I'm not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true Zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twice.Two whole times on that Wand Wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original Gamecube release and second with its Wii U HD re-release that this is not the way that they envisioned the Legend Of Zelda series, this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result Wand Wacker flopped mightily BOTH times as such a Benedict Arnold or Rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to do.To rephrase a quote from Ridley Scott's Gladiator: &#34;Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Zelda and this is not it, THIS IS NOT IT!&#34;We were lied to and led to believe that the epic, cool, badass, Spaceworld 2000 realistically presented Zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the Gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed Celda Wand Wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and Nintendo's way (before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love Wand Wacker in order to shill and run damage control for Nintendo while real Zelda fans have abandoned Nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or PC gaming if they haven't simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of Zelda's true fans.Eiji Aonuma the hack no talent Jimmy Fallon Of Japan enabled by the out of touch Shigeru Miyamoto has been ruining the Zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as Majora's Mask.Aonuma's first game &#34;Marvelous&#34; failed (MARVELOUSLY!) and he had no credentials at all to be given the Zelda series but insanely Nintendo gave it to him and ever since he's been driving Zelda along with it's sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad NPC filled faux Zelda game after another.When the truth of the matter is Zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light RPG elements thrown in for good measure.Aonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of Zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongs.In anycase to re-iterate so as to set this very important point in stone once more:Wand Wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient (as is typical of Aonuma offerings).Conclusion: My rating of this turd is 1 star since I can't give it lower due to how Amazon's system is set up.</td><td>02 21, 2014</td><td>AZGQXYB4TAODL</td><td>FightForTheLost</td><td>The most hated videogame of all time and greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history</td><td>1392940800</td></tr><tr><td>7100027950</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I was worried that it would not work.

On your journey you will seek sunken treasures, solve puzzles, navigate mazes, fight sea monstors, Gannon's minions, and finally Gannon himself.I give this game:4 stars for graphics. The cartoon charactors faces show cute animated emotions.4 stars for challenge. Finding hidden treasures is very challenging, there are so many worlds you will want to take your time and check out everything. (It will take forever to backtrack.)3 stars for navigation.

That is, I regret missing the chance to preorder it. This is easily the most controversial game in the Legend of Zelda franchise. People were looking forward to another Zelda with the look, feel, and design of the N64 masterpieces. Instead, we got a much more cartoon-like look and feel, with numerous differences in design, including Link's own abilities (i.e. sidling against a wall) and a wide, open ocean world that seemed too much like the real ocean: mostly empty. However, after giving it a fair chance, I'm happy to say that Wind Waker more than stands out as a classic game. Link's facial expressions can be hilarious, the story is mind-blowing, the gameplay and design are fantastic. If you don't like exploring the world as much, for the most part you can breeze right through if you want to (there is a good chunk nearing the end of the game where you have to explore various islands, and spend a hefty sum of rupees as well). However, if you do like to explore, this Zelda is overflowing with opportunities, as the more you look, the more you find. What stands out in my mind is that, being as naive as I am, this was the first game that had a major plot twist that I never saw coming. My jaw was agape for several moments. That's what puts this game near the top of my all-time favorites.</td><td>10 24, 2011</td><td>AHG2EE6W4HNAA</td><td>taylor20</td><td>Altering the Legend</td><td>1319414400</td></tr><tr><td>7100027950</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>One of the best zelda titles ever!

Overall in a simple connection it should work fine, but in a entertainment system where are some other devices, as home theater, networking equipment, etc, the cable will pick a LOT of Noise.  Also it should be a permanent installation, since it is not sturdy enough to resist multiple pulling in / out of the connectors.  Otherwise it will do the trick, and having your WII in 480P will not make it a HD console, that the wii is not capable of, but picture will be clearer, sharper (I don't know, but in my 40\" LCD image out of the standard cable seems a bit blurry)and with more defined colors</td><td>09 28, 2010</td><td>A2KQYVYOJNESEY</td><td>RG</td><td>You Get what you pay</td><td>1285632000</td></tr><tr><td>7293000936</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>This pair of component cables are great!

Best thing about this is you can bring in any character from previously saved game and complete game in 'extreme' mode. This now unlocks another character with super weapons.

This adds fun by switching characters and then playing their mission.

ATLUS localizes (brings to USA) some of the best JRPG's out there.  The style from the cover hints that music has a lot to do with the game's charm and good nature.  This game is great for all ages because it focuses on good nature themes: love, music, custmization of mech, and simplicity.A Gamestop employee was really excited about this game becasue of the many instuments you play.  This was a good year before the music game craze game came to the US: \"Guitar Hero\", \"Rock Band\", and \"Just Dance\".  There are no physical insruments to buy in \"Steabot Chronicles\" all music mini-games are Dual Shock 2 controlled and plays very effectively, rewarding, and simpley.First you play harmonica, then a piano, then a trumpet through a mini game onscreen menu not all that different from \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Frequency/Amplitude\" really simple to understand and very rewarding to master (the game rewards player with exra in game money from tips think piano bar).  The cell shaded graphics here are rather timeless, I just played it in 2012 and found the game aged well.Why not 5 stars?  The controll of the Mech is a little backwards.  I didn't notice enough controll options for it to play like a traditional dual analog third person action/ RPG like traditonal games play (\"Halo\", \"Transformer\", \"Zone of the Enders\", or \"Mech Assault\".  If you play and really struggle with the controlls like breaking a wall to progress from the first area, I'd recomend to keep trying, but the game requires very precise controlls in some areas and this game may not be for you.  Again, great for all ages a really good natured game that we here in the US are lucky to have!</td><td>02 16, 2013</td><td>A12USB1U8UPSTH</td><td>Brian Burniske</td><td>Musical Mini-Games were ahead of its time</td><td>1360972800</td></tr><tr><td>7540727705</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>This game was on my personal wish list for a long time.

Unlike the other various atelier games, you aren't punished in this one by time constraints so you are welcome to farm as many materials for alchemy as you want to.There isn't anything too amazing about the stories in either game, but it is the combat system that really hooks you. Not enough jrpgs have a fun turn based battle system. They use a battle gauge that fills up on regular attacks and you spend it for more powerful attacks or spells. On top of the decision making that requires, the turn order gauge also plays an important role. Higher speed determines how fast you move to the right side of the bar for your turn to be had. Pushing the enemies back to the far left side of the bar with a break attack stuns them and allows for an auto crit on them. Since break attacks cant build up the attack gauge, you have to balance out each players turn to figure out how best to beat each boss.Since then i've enjoyed other games with this sort of shared system in place. I highly recommend arc rise fantasia if you like this combat style.

It is what creates the majority of the fear and panic you will experience.While the game is on the shorter side compared to the others, I would also argue that it has the most variety.  You will never be bored with/comfortable in any of the environments, (as happened occasionally in the previous games).The gameplay hasn't changed significantly from the previous 2 games (save for some new weapons, a block move, and substantially fewer bullets and health items than were in SH2), and it isn't particularly \"fun\" to play, but the constantly oppressive atmosphere will steal most, if not all your attention, form this.My opinion:  Silent Hill is not about fun, it's about being scared, (and you WILL be scared playing SH3)</td><td>11 13, 2010</td><td>A3PURKDUXIJLVR</td><td>i&lt;3H0rr0r</td><td>Quite disturbing (in a good way)</td><td>1289606400</td></tr><tr><td>7561321074</td><td>List(0, 1)</td><td>5.0</td><td>Great game, In my mind the best in ther series....easy to play not too hard,puzzles are easy to figure out, grat replay value.

Which I was looking for originally but when I found it I only found it used and the price was not worth it.

Having the player's guide is extremely helpful when it comes to playing the game. Plus this game is not as hard as Twilight Princess or any of the older or newer Zelda games out there. I don't mind that its a cartoon that doesn't bother me in the least. Overall I give this game 5 stars the controls are easy the camera is free moving. Plus I highly recommend this to any person who is still deciding if they want to buy the Wii U version of this game or someone who wants to buy the original. If you want to know how this game works I would recommend the original Gamecube version first and then buy the HD version for Wii U. The Gamecube version just gives you an idea what your in for.

I was eager to get this game because I had seen some great in-game footage of the AC-130 mission and landings were now included. Before I start telling you why this game is a disappointment let me tell you what is good about it.1) The graphics are just as good if not better than the first HAWX. The detail of the maps are great and give you an almost there feel. The planes seem better as well. The plane graphics seem more realistic with a more war worn look that's not as clean as before.2) It's more realistic. Even though you still have a ton of missiles available it seems the designers spent more time making it tougher to hit the target.3) The A.I. is a lot more difficult. Gone are the days of sending out 4 missiles at a time, every map, at every threat. I only remember one map where multi-target was available and that was for ground targets.4) New technology. You not only get to control an AC-130 but there are drones and precision guided bombs that expand the gameplay.Now for the not-so-good parts of the game. I really like tough games, they are a challenge and make for more fun but this game almost made me snap the disc in half. Here's why.1) Your wingmen are absolute garbage. They don't seem to do anything other than warn you of incoming missiles, as if the red warning lights, picture in picture, and warning buzzers weren't enough.2) You will spent 90% of your time dodging missiles and 10% of your time TRYING to have a decent dog fight. The MIG-29's are great they are extremely tough to get a lock on but as soon as you get any where close to missile lock you have to break off in order to escape incoming missiles.3) The missions are scripted. You can't pick which targets to engage like you could in the first HAWX. If you are trying to protect a ground base from tanks you'll be forced to break off and take out incoming fighters. When you attempt to kill the fighters the ground forces practically destroy the base. Once you get rid of the fighters and try to take on the ground forces again you are taken to a cut-scene or the mission ends. That's what really gets me, the enemy doesn't retreat if you overwhelm them like the first, its just over.4) The storyline is boring. Rebel forces take over some Russian nukes, WOW that hasn't been done to death. Thankfully you can skip the load-screens after about thirty seconds.5) This isn't that big of a deal but the game is pretty sexist. There is a female pilot who talks quite a bit throughout the campaign and she is pretty much the only source of a \"team\" feel. When she talks she is almost instantly told to be quite by one of your wingmen. In the end she sacrifices herself trying to take out an enemy target and the game is like, \"alright she's dead who's up next?\".6) No choices of what planes or missile packages you get to fight with. You are given some really bad planes to take into combat and don't expect to play with to many US aircraft, the game is set as a world conflict so you only get to play the F-22 and Warthog in a couple missions, otherwise your Russian, French or English.The first game was great it had creative and fun missions like protecting the President of the United States and taking on wave after wave of ground targets. This game is intense but I would say its not very fun. There seems to have been a complete lack of imagination on this one. I have only played the multiplayer a few times and it seems to be a rank up as you go system so maybe that is worth the price of the game. All I can say is the campaign is a huge let down.ALL FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED.

I found the original HAWX, while definitely on the arcade side of the spectrum, to be fun and engaging.After eagerly awaiting the release of Hawx2 (PC version) for a number of months, I received it from Amazon (no local stores had it) to find that it required a permanent Internet connection to play; not just to install, but for actual game play. Since I do not play games on the Internet, and my larger gaming (flight sim) PCs don't even have an Internet connection. I had to return the game, unopened.While the majority of PC gamers do play on line, there are some of us who don't and have no desire to. I fully understand Ubisoft's concern over piracy, but they are excluding a number of previous and potential customers by attempting to lock down their product in this way. Honestly, it seems like all it will accomplish is to force \"hackers\" to come up with a crack for it sooner rather than later.After doing a few Internet searches, it seems that A. Ubisoft has done this with several games in the past and B. that there is a fairly loud voice of outrage over it, not only by those, like me, who don't play over the Internet, but those who would like the option of using the game when an Internet connection isn't available. Oddly enough, the same game for Wii or Xbox doesn't have this requirement.If the game plays like Ubisoft's previous sims, I'm sorry I won't be able to see it.

I also have to leave the PS2 controller plugged in while playing with the n64 controller.Be willing to sit down and tinker around with your control settings. When I got it to work with pj64 (sorry, can't speak for any other programs), I configured the PS2 controller first with the default Jabo plugin, then switched it over and configured the n64 controller using N-Rage. If you have a basic/good working knowledge of emulators and controller configuration, you should be able to work your way through.Once configured, she works (almost completely) like a charm. Every now and then the adapter likes to have a fit, but a simple unplug-replug fixes that.For those wondering if you can run two controllers at the same time on this, the answer is NO. You can't use one of these adapters for multiplayer--it must be switched to EITHER n64 OR PS2. You CAN use the Mayflash adapter for multiplayer.If you want an n64-only controller adapter, go for the Mayflash adapter (with 2 ports). I also own one of them, and really, they are MUCH easier to configure.

Small note, you might want to clean up your old controllers for them to work their best).- From your Control Panel, go to Game Controller.  Set up your Original N64 Controller in there.  To do that, Make sure your controller is plugged in, then go to Properties > Settings, then click the \"Calibrate\" button.  Follow the set up.  Remember Up&Down; are on the Y Axis and Left&Right; are on the X Axis).- Then you want the newest release of NRage Input Plugin:  [...]- Take your time reading the NRage Setup page. Really read it.- To make the Joy Stick work (In the NRage Control), just go to the \"Analog Stick\" section.  Then Up for UP, Down for Down, etc...  Remember to input your other buttons as well.  Finally save your control settings!If you think this is complicated, well, it can be.  There are lots of forums out there to help.

Apparently some users have reporter the buttons going crazy whenever the configuration is switched to use the N64 port. This is true...IF you don't plug in a PS2 controller at the same time. Apparently there is a design flaw that causes the signal to mess up without a PS2 controller in the port, so that can be problematic if you don't own one. Not to mention it can be slightly annoying to calibrate. At least with my controller, sometimes pushing the analog stick in a direction doesn't always make it go all the way, so it takes some fiddling. If you do what I described it will work fine, and it's fully compatible with Win 7.Because of the above flaws, however, I can't rate it more than 3 stars. If you have both controllers and need an adapter for both, then this will suit you fine. However, if you want just an adapter for the N64 only I would recommend getting something specifically for that purpose over this dual adapter.</td><td>03 6, 2011</td><td>A3OUIV77UF406W</td><td>Mark M. \"M\"</td><td>Works With Windows 7 + How To Get the N64 Port to Work</td><td>1299369600</td></tr><tr><td>8565000168</td><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>2.0</td><td>showed up on time and was well packed but.. when i plugged it in it didnt work with my games</td><td>10 5, 2009</td><td>A2FGYF4PA8S6TC</td><td>Matthew Hammer \"hambone79\"</td><td>good  seller but.....</td><td>1254700800</td></tr><tr><td>8565000168</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>1.0</td><td>It's a cool piece of hardware in theory, but it needs to be re-worked.

Important note - you do not need an XBOS controller, your Logitech works just fine once you map the keys and joysticks to your liking.  It is very easy to do (from the settings screen on the launcher before the game is run).The game looks to be written in C++, which makes it lag free and it seems well optimized.  No glitches (a first for a FIFA on PC), the defenders defend, and do it well.  No retardation.  The attackers look for running in the channels and on the flanks, all without any prompting from you, the player.I have read one review about this game having \"confusing\" controls compared to other FIFA's on PC.  So basically someone was complaining about the 360 degree of movement and passing, the thing which I am raving about.FACEPALM.Anyway, to sum this disjointed rant - AI is good, both defending and attacking.  The ball physics look good.  No glitches after several days of playing.  If you love Winning Eleven/Pro Evo (like I do), BUY this game.  If you are a FIFA fan, BUY this game.

The game of course, not the year. I purchased this after knowing it isn't the same battlefield most of us know. Maps are smaller(thanks consolitis, the disease thats killing pc gaming) but surprisingly it totally works for this style of game. You really can't compare this to the COD series as its on its own. This is more of a close quarter combat game but not restrictive like the cod series thanks to the elements that make bf games what they are... awesome. Vehicles and Destruction equals beautiful. Anyone who was let down by the hyped up Mw2 multiplayer circus will find refuge here. The multiplayer is balanced. Its team based. So make sure you have your mic plugged in as communication is key. The sound quality is amazing. The game runs smooth on a decent machine. Just so you know though, you can make this run on some single core systems (set everything to low in the config file).. it isn't pretty, but it does work. I tested it out in eyefinity running a 5970 with intels new 6 core cpu.. not that the 6 core cpu was needed, but the system was powerful. Eyefinity gives this game a whole new level of enjoyable play. Then I tested 3d out on my nvidia powered rig. Freaking awesome. If you have the hardware you need this game. Just remember its totally different than bf2.. no prone.. no crazy large maps.. but it works, and it works well.Anyway point is.. it has the pace of cod, with the greatness of BF2.</td><td>04 15, 2010</td><td>A30NVUH45PGJSR</td><td>N.

It's a big waste of game playing time in my opinion...2)  Why not sell a \"Prima\" guide for this game the public could buy for say $20.00 bucks, instead of the $130.00 dollar guide only 8 people can buy.  Seems to me they could have made alot of money with the former.3)  Good size maps but only 32 player max???..  Which makes it difficult to mount a defense (conquest) because this game is all designed around flanking your opponents.  Which brings me to another point.  Why have a sniper class?  The game doesn't allow you to go prone, and you have to hold down the \"crouch\" button to stay crouched.  Having been a 2142 player for years, with larger maps and more players I found these issues to be extremely gay!4)  Now I like realism in the game, but this game was SOOO.. Freaking Bouncy I was getting headaches and I had to turn down the pitch and yaw in \"video options\" All the way, just to normalize the game enough to make it playable.5)  I'm not sure what \"Autobalance\" is for, because every map I go to in multi-player the teams are ALWAYS LOP-SIDED! And not just a little, I mean usally I enter a server and the weakest team is getting HAMMERED!  I can't count how many times I've gotten killed as soon as I spawned.6) Back to the sniper class: it would be nice if your weapons (rifles) actually did some damage. With reloading time, and with the game designed for only agressive flanking play, I run around with my knife and get more kills.7) I've got good video and sound, yet I had to turn my video to the low setting cause the game was too choppy, and the sound of the voices in the missions go in and out in volume no matter what I have the sound options set to.8)  The single player missions are not as good as MW2's, + ie no buddy-ing up in the missions.Ok, enough bitching now SOME GOOD POINTS:With all it's flaws the multi-player part of the game is better than MW2, just because you can actually kill anyone, and it's not a Wall Hack ORAMA...-->like MW2. Having PunkBuster/Evenbalance in this game makes a huge difference!  There's just Too Many Noobs out there that want to pad their stats by hacking or glitching, which of course ruins the game.It's a fun game, however it makes me wonder what EA and IW were actually thinking when they created this next generation in fps's.  With all the new stuff I have to ask are any of these guys/creators fps gamers?If you were wondering which game to buy..  MW2 or BC2, buyem both. That way you can have what the designers should have given us after SOOO MANY releases.Just Buy This One First.</td><td>06 10, 2010</td><td>A2X4MTE0W8DF6V</td><td>Serious Ed</td><td>So much effort to create this game, but are the programmers gamers?</td><td>1276128000</td></tr><tr><td>8990289440</td><td>List(2, 2)</td><td>4.0</td><td>Well, this review is going to be focused on those that are either new to the game or have yet to buy it. This game is bad! Very Bad! And I mean that in a good way. It is so fun to play!Update* I have been playing this game exclusively for six months now. It still has just as much fun (if not more) from day one. BUY NEW FOR V.I.P. code for free map pack downloads. If buying new...buy the 'Ultimate version' Learn to play on the normal maps first. Remember, if you are new, remember others have been playing this game for a LONG while, they most likely have all the weapons unlocked. There is a weapons 'add-on' pack to unlock ALL weapons you can buy from the EA store. it is $15... may be worth it for you.If you decide not to, remember, if you see someone die, PICK UP THEIR WEAPON pack... it is probably better than yours. If they are a medic, REVIVE the player who died after you pick up their pack, especially if you are the 'attacking' team.I own all the MW games and Halo games and the BC games.I have two gaming PCs, a Wii, XBOXs consoles, and now a PS3.I decided to buy this for my PS3 a couple months back ( I own only a handful of games for my PS3) after reading the reviews on it about the importance of team play and the incredible surround sound you can get from your home theatre system.This game is not MW2, the controls are way different and involve some-what of a learning curve, and the game play quite different than just running around killing as many people as you can.The single player portion of the game is okay. I still like it but the old BF are better, even the Halo series, MWs, or Half-Life's are noticeably better.But I am sure those that buy this game are buying it for the multiplayer experience. And this is where it separates itself from the rest!!!Leveling up is all about being a team player! You can loss a match, and still gain alot of experience points and possibly level up because you helped your team-mates. This game is more of a war-chess game. You have to know what piece you are going to be during a re-spawn depending on your team-mates skill level and what your team is trying to accomplish.Now, one thing I must say is this game is an ADULT GAME! PERIOD! The F bomb is frequently dropped during play even during multiplayer via the computer and not necessarily by online players though that can and does happen too. The game can be set to turn off some of the colorful character comments... but it is still not full proof and VERY LIMTED and difficult to do, you'll lose team-help message cues like \"need ammo\" \"I need a medic\" etc. It is ashamed the DICE game developers could not have made that an option in the game. It could have been easily added to the programming code.WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS GAME...or any team-based FPS, is to GET YOURSELF A GOOD CHAT MIKE-HEADPHONE combo unit like a Turtle Beach PX21 which will set you back about eighty George Washingtons! Playing with a mike and headphones is a must for ANY SERIOUS gamer. It is amazing how many people STILL do not use mikes with their PS3s. Now, a PS3 is more likely in the hands of adults. They buy it for the blue-ray -home theatre- gaming all-in-one compatibility. But being able to communicate with your squad is a must. Those teams that have good communications will win every time very simply. I'll write more of this later. A headset/mike combo prevents your team mates hearing your sound system via your chat mike which is VERY un-cool and annoying! If you can not communicate with your squad, this game will tend to get frustrating at times because you'll see your squad about to do something that you know will hurt your team, but have no way of warning them.I am a 40ish guy that still remembers the old 300 baud modems, Quake-I days of FPSs and the three-grand PC game systems! Well, let's start first at the graphics... I'll start and say they are a step below MW2... The frame rate is 30 FPS verses MW2 60 FPS. That being said, there is a massive amount of more information needing to be transmitted for BC2 verses MW2 because of the massive map sizes and the constant map changes due to environmental destruction, far away player locations, etc, if you understand packets and networking you'll understand why they limit the game to 30 FPS). That being said, the graphics still are amazing for a console system! ( Nothing beats a great gaming PC; but most people can not afford a 2k gaming system though)Now for the sound... the surround sound is literally AMAZING! The sound beats any game hands down. Explosions rock the house on my home theatre system. You can hear bullets wiz by your ears, and screams in the distance. That being said, this game is NOT for kids or young teens strictly for the language. F bombs are very common and are the very way it would be if you were in a real combat situation. These can be limited via the menu, but obvious are still in the multiplayer chat mode where real players talk real trash!!! The language tends to be much better than XBOX360 online community just because the game community is simply 'older' and more mature in the PS3 community!The sound of Tanks and Jets and Helicopter rumble the whole house. SCARY! I'm thinking you could get a case of \"post traumatic stress sydrome\" from playing this game. The Surround sound sounds just like you are there and seems to come from just where it is happening like in real life... if the sound is to your right far away it sounds it too! Bullets even echo and ricochet sound inside metal structures. You can even hear flesh wounds from bullets and the screams of combat victims.Not enough can be said about the destructible environments. You need go to youtube videos of game play. Destructible environments truly change the whole game play every time you play. Forest can be leveled to the ground. Entire building can be collapsed on your enemies killing everyone inside.You can get in a three story build and take some C4 and blew a wall out without windows to be able to spot enemies as a Recon class.Now, one thing I dislike about the game is the lack of custom programming of button layouts. You can not choose what buttons do what. There are some pre-programmed changes you can do but they are VERY limited.The other thing that is a negative is the networking, not the game networking, but the PS3. No LAN party support either! HUGE mistake on Dice's part! If you want to play, you all must get online and join a BC2 server to play.Now granted, the networking is free with the PS3, which I like a lot. I have had only a few games that have booted me off. I would like to be able to choose what game I play depending on the `pings', which there is no way of knowing this via the game. All said ... the networking is far better than I ever expected. The other thing is this game does not allow two players to play through one game system. That is where MW2 and Halo shine when you have friends over. LAN SUPPORT should have been there!Now on game play... TEAM WORK is a MUST! A GOOD Mike/headset is a must!Remember... this game has a more realistic bullet curves due to gravity and a time delay hitting the target over long distance shooting involving a learning curve. Leveling up to gain the 12x Milli-dot scope is a must! And shooting ahead of running targets is important over long ranges.There are four classes: Assault, Engineer, Medic and Recon Class. Each has its own weaknesses and strengths depending on your team-mates skills and what type of game is being played, team-DM, conquest, rush, etc. I play mostly the \"Rush\" mode. Now Rush-mode is where there are two teams, `attackers' and `defenders'. \"Defenders\" have unlimited re-spawn lives, where the \"Attackers\" get 75 re-spawn lives total for all players to accomplish their goal of blowing up two-of six total communication cases marked `A' and `B'. Don't just get yourself killed guys if you are attackers! If you accomplish this then the re-spawn limit for attackers resets to 75, if your team runs out of re-spawn lives before this, you lose. Now if you do this for each pair of three missions, your attacking team wins.If you are new, remember spotting and tagging enemies is a must via your `select' button, even before shooting them. An orange triangle tags that enemy player for about 5 seconds. This tells other team-mates where the enemy is in force. Often a player will sneak into your base, and wait for re-spawning players to re-spawn on their hiding position. Than after re-enforcements arrive they'll squad attack. If you spawn at someone's position. Don't stand beside them, find a spot about 15 paces or more away. Too easy to gernade-launch the two of you otherwise.Now, recon is a good class is you are patient. Most people will `sniper' attack and fire on the enemy... which does nothing for an `Attacking' team-player. Kills are important if you are a Defender team-player. If you are a recon (sniper)...remember, one shot-one kill, that means HEAD SHOTS! You want to get the attacking team from 75 to 0 as quickly as possible to win the match. Setting four C4 three times on a communication case will destroy also.Medics can bring teammates back from the dead. Gaining 80 points each time they heal a team mate. Medics and Assault class also have very powerful machine guns.When you die, the player who killed you is seen via third-person position which gives a general idea where they were at but not in 'hardcore' mode.This game is very fun. You can drive ATVs, Tanks, Humvees, Jet-skis, Motor boats, and Helicopters, and RC drones. The sound will knock your socks off! I have put all my other games down since I begun to play this game. There is nothing like loading up a drone with C4 and flying it into a group of your enemies and setting it off. If you want to get away from games that just have you running around and killing everyone you can, this game is for you.Remember, MICROPHONE IS A MUST, use your cell-phone bluetooth headset if you have to at least; Headphone-mic (turtlebeach 21) combo is best that way your teammates do not hear your sound system through your mike (Which is way annoying and distracting)!</td><td>09 26, 2010</td><td>A3LOAQX4DVQPCS</td><td>Southernreign \"SR\"</td><td>Very bad game!

So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision.The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end.The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series.First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary \"Time Compression\" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot dont too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers.Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though.Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats.Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.</td><td>08 13, 2008</td><td>A1UPWXH1L5E3G7</td><td>Darth Borg</td><td>Great concept but equally flawed game....</td><td>1218585600</td></tr><tr><td>907843905X</td><td>List(4, 5)</td><td>4.0</td><td>An excellent simulation with excellent ship models.

So if you want to go from New York to London forget it because in the game there is nothing between the two.  Additionally, the graphics on this game are about ten years behind the high end games sold today.  Also, while the cover artwork of this game deceptively resembles MS Flight Simulator's cover artwork, MS has NOTHING to do with this product. Do not expect a start to finish trip in this game like you have in any of the MS Flight Simulator versions.  You are basically limited to sailing an ocean liner, tanker, or cruise and cargo ships up and down some harbor like New York.  The missions prove to be the bright spot in this game.  They are fun and interactive.  But once you work your way through the missions there is nothing more the game will offer.  Unlike MS Flight Simulator where player created trips are limitless, once the missions are complete in Ship Simulator the game has nothing to offer.

I must admit the Speed Boat is cool as the Jetskies, Hovercraft and other fast (manuerable) watercraft to speed around on that is a blast...but I really am not so happy with it and this is exactly why, the missions hard to understand, very abstract and disorienting, if not done in the right sequence with multiple boats the mission remains incomplete, and they give you a list of boats with no clue as to what sequence to follow, the Tugs handle like (CRAP) as with the Cruise Liner, freighter and other larger vessels, yes I get that the game is aimed toward realism and respect that they handle that way in real life but lets be real, when I have a half a mile to spare and Im full reverse thrusting the Rotterdam Ferry and using full rudder and bow thrusters and I still slam into a boat, dock at (three) knots and sink and fail the mission that is just not acceptable.  I waisted a whole month trying to figure this game out and my whole morning going across the seas only to crash the Russian Tug into the Agile Solutions Freighter that I tried to tow from getting stranded on a dock from a game glitch...I am so glad that it was free off my Amazon gift card that I recieved for Christmas.  Because if I spent my hard earned money on this game I have to say I would have been quite upset.  Time to wipe this hog off my valuable hard drive and start over. If you want a good simulation game I highly recommend Flight Sim 2004 or FSX which is excellent and does the job. The seaplane is a blast and there are many downloads for the programs including a hovercraft from Hama Mitsuya that atleast has a spray effect where as the one in Ship simulaotr does not:-(( It is also equally as realistic:-))  I think I know what programs I highly value from now on. To wrap it up in a sumary Ship Sim '08 is a good game just not great since half of its ships and missions are unrealistic, Just my opinion.</td><td>01 24, 2013</td><td>A16JFNC1MVIP0L</td><td>Scott</td><td>The high seas are not so high</td><td>1358985600</td></tr><tr><td>907843905X</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>My son loved the game!

With that in mind, when I opened the plastic packaging and merely set the skin on my dresser to pick up the controller, it had already attracted a nice array of cat hair when I came back to put it on.

I have several different kinds of game cases now.  These are far superior in my opinion.  I find most cases a little tight to open.  But most others have the games pop out if you are not careful, which can be a problem on a plane or even in a car between the seats.  There are 4 pages that hold 4 games front and back of each.  Each page securely hold each game with plastic tabs that are easy to insert into and remove from.  There is no reasonable chance of the games coming lose.  The hard shell protects them very well.  It is a very compact way to hold 16 games.  I prefer these over any of my other cases for bulk storage.As compact as it is, it still is a bit much to fit into a small carry case with your XL unless you have a larger bag.  So what I do is use a smaller 3-game case or thicker 8-game case but still thinner than this which fit easily into my XL carry case depending on which I use.  I really don't need 16 available on the go.  So I primarily use this to tote backup games when I am not sure which I want to take with me on a trip, or to simply store games that don't have a case of their own because I bought them used.This 4 pack is such a good value if still reasonably priced.  I had no problem with delivery, construction, or defects.  They even came with a nice friendly note.

The case snaps right on very easily and fits snugly so your LL/XL wont be sliding around causing any scratching on the glossy surface.  It's not going to keep anything from preventing damage if you drop your DS on the sidewalk or anything - but it's also not being advertised as such. It's a simple and quite nice looking case to protect the surface for your LL/XL from becoming muched with fingerprints and from getting scratched... and it does a perfect job at what it's supposed to do.The ONLY way I could have liked this case even more is is the surface was a tiny bit textured in some way, in order to make it a bit less \"slippery\" in your hands - although again, it's not being advertised as such so it's not an issue. In terms of \"slippery-ness\" it IS leaps and bounds superior to the aforementioned silicon case I had, which you could barely hold on to without fear of dropping the DS.All in all I have absolutely no hesitation recommending this item to any LL/XL owners looking for a case.

It's a third party controller, and a cheap one at that. For the most part it works fine, but with both of the controllers I purchased there is one button that either is resistant to being pushed, or else doesn't register pushing at high frequencies. Neither issue makes most games unplayable, but either could be frustrating in certain circumstances. Still, if you need backup controllers, you can buy a few of these for what one official controller would cost, and probably find several that you wouldn't mind using for most circumstances. I recently used one to play through one of my favorite games and had no problems. For its cost, it's really hard to complain too much, even if it is somewhat imperfect.</td><td>06 1, 2012</td><td>A2YKRNLUROXTZY</td><td>Michael P.

The product works just like it says it does, and the extension cable allows me to play from a distance (it reaches really far). So I would definitely recommend this if you need a Gamecube controller, just be careful not to drop it, since it is still prone to breaking easy.
